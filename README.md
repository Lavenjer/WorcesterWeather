This is my cyclist weather safety web application (in development):

  Full-stack web application using Django MVC architecture and database models.
  Dynamic day-based filtering using datetime queries.
  Structured modular URL routing and separated logic intro service layers for scalability.
  Implemented database querying and filtering using DJango ORM.
  Languages used: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL.

This project aims to improve cyclist's safety in Worcester by showing the weather conditions and simplifying the results into a "safety index" (in development) which helps the user understand
the data at a glance.

During my fall semester at university, I cycled 40 minutes every day to attend my classes. However, as the weather grew more uncertain, I was not able to use my e-bicycle to commute to my university.
I needed to be able to tell if the weather was suitable or not at the tip of my fingers. Since others are likely struggling with the same issues here in Worcester, I decided to develop an app to
simplify the process whilst making it very user-friendly so that someone who is less savvy about the weather can check the conditions in an instant. With this goal in mind, I began my work on this app.

Features planned:

  Weighted "Cycling Safety Index" algorithm which uses variables like wind speed, precipitation probability, temperature, visibility, etc to return a score from 0-100 for user-friendliness.
  Fully designed webpages with links, acknowledgements, and more.
  Deployment on AWS or Azure with a place to recieve feedback to aid the production phase.

This is my cyclist weather safety web application (in development):

  Full-stack web application using Django MVC architecture and database models.
  Dynamic day-based filtering using datetime queries.
  Structured modular URL routing and separated logic intro service layers for scalability.
  Implemented database querying and filtering using DJango ORM.

Features planned:

  Weighted "Cycling Safety Index" algorithm which uses variables like wind speed, precipitation probability, temperature, visibility, etc to return a score from 0-100 for user-friendliness.
  Fully designed webpages with links, acknowledgements, and more.
  Deployment on AWS or Azure with a place to recieve feedback to aid the production phase.
